    "title": "Starting the PhD off on the Right Foot",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Advice I Wish I’d had from Day 1 of the PhD\n\nAlmost every deadline is actually 2 weeks earlier than advertised.\nAny time you require a letter of recommendation, the effective deadline for your materials is two weeks earlier than the advertised deadline. This is because, for almost every competition, you have to send your finalized materials to your letter writers at least two weeks in advance so they can prepare their letters. Moreover, you should let your letter writers know about deadlines and letters even earlier if possible. This is courteous and demonstrates that you are organized.\n\n\nBe strategic about your writing.\nMy husband, a professor in statistics who is years ahead of me in academia, once told me while I was still a PhD student: “Be strategic about your writing. Never write anything that isn’t directly related to your academic profile or that you can’t repurpose for a future publication.”\nThis was great advice. There are so many reasons to be strategic when you are a graduate student and junior scholar. For one, if you are serious about staying in academia, you must recognize that the job market is saturated, so there isn’t a lot of flexibilty to “waste” time on projects that don’t build your academic profile. There are also many ways of being strategic. For instance, I encourage my PhD advisees to think about their future dissertation when writing course papers. If an entire paper can be shifted into a chapter or the contextual info from a piece can be used in the introduction, that makes writing the dissertation less onerous and will decrease your time-to-degree. If something can’t be used for the dissertation, then try to revise it for a peer-reviewed publication. This applies to course papers, grant applications, and conference presentations.\n\n\nEmbrace cynicism.\nThis relates to the above piece of advice on strategic writing. You should think strategically about how you spend your time, what activities you become involved in, what service you say “yes” to, where you present papers and who you present with, etc. It may seem craven to think of every aspect of your university experience as contributing to your academic profile. However, I would ask: if you aren’t here to build an academic profile and eventually get a job (then tenure, then promotion, etc.), then what are you doing?\n\n\nThe most important parts of the PhD have nothing to do with program requirements.\nAttending talks, working on a journal, grabbing a post-seminar beer with your classmates, taking a visiting scholar on a campus tour, organizing a graduate student symposium, presenting at a conference, attending a weekly reading group, moderating a film screening… none of these activities appear on any document related to degree requirements, however, in my experience, they are the most formative elements of a graduate degree. This is not only due to the utilitarian benefit of “networking” (although it is that, too!), but more importantly, it relates to learning about different methodologies, bouncing your ideas off your cohort and colleagues, seeing how projects are developed in different fields, getting to know people outside of your department, etc. These activities and experiences are gratifying and challenging, and you will have the opportunity to pick up new skills and develop broader ways of thinking and analyzing material. There are other enormous benefits that cannot be foreseen or quantified. For instance, you might identify a letter writer from outside of your field, meet a professor whose work intersects with your own and be offered an RAship that relates to your project, land a position that helps you identify alt-ac careers that interest you, pick up a new skill that enhances your CV, etc. Some of the most important growth of a well-rounded PhD journey should take place outside of your department.\n\n\nPublications and letters of recommendation are the most important elements of job applications\nIf your goal is to land a tenure-track position after the PhD, then there are two elements of your future job materials that are more important than all of the rest: the letters of recommendation your mentors will write you and the “Publications” section of your CV. There are other important components, of course. For instance, you should spend lots of time on writing a polished cover letter (which will get your foot in the door so that search committees will read the rest of your materials) and have a tight research statement that shows that you have projects and thoughts beyond the dissertation. However, having a publication or two in recognized, respected journals demonstrates that you know how to play the academic game and will give search committees confidence that you will get tenured. In terms of the letters of recommendation, your mentors will speak to myriad aspects of you as a future colleague and researcher. They will attest to your research potential, vouch for your generosity and collegiality, speak to your teaching and mentoring abilities and potential, and remark on elements of your profile that you won’t even think of. These testimonies are incredibly important for piquing the interest of the committee and instilling confidence that you will be a productive, non-toxic potential colleague.\nDo note that having strong letters of recommendation should, hopefully, not require anything wildly out of the ordinary from you. If you are in a PhD program, you no doubt are driven, deeply interested in your field, intelligent, and willing to go through a lot of metaphorical pain for a degree (long hours, meeting tight deadlines, tackling challenging readings, putting time into important extracurriculars, etc.). Given your mentorship relationship with your letter writers, they will know all about your academic and extracurricular activities, and they will be able to articulate these in their letters of support. Finally, needing strong letters of recommendation does NOT mean you need to grovel or put up with an abusive or toxic advisor. The relationship with your advisor should provide a safe, constructive mentorship dynamic. No letter of recommendation is worth being mistreated."

    "title": "Compiling a High Quality Bibliography",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An advisee was recently dealing with one of the many scholarly inconveniences of the coronavirus pandemic. After having to cancel a research trip to Mexico, she needed access to a less-studied text that is only available in select Mexican bookstores (and nearly impossible to obtain in Canada). She had done good legwork and exhausted many avenues in her attempts to locate the text: She’d googled like mad, sought the text via interlibrary loan, requested that our UBC librarian purchase the book, asked the Mexican bookstore if it would ship her the book, etc. Her efforts, unfortunately, were unsuccessful. So in a biweekly meeting, she asked if I had any additional ideas. I gave her some suggestions (write the author, write the publisher, ask on social media), but after the meeting, I started looking myself. Within an hour, I’d found the text online.\nIt’s difficult to describe what a fruitful search for resources looks like, because it’s often akin to a Wikipedia linkfest that takes a researcher down myriad rabbitholes–most of them futile, a select few diamond mines. Here, I’ll describe some of my tried and true strategies, and I’ll explain how I found that elusive text that my student had been hunting down for weeks.\n\nA High-Quality Bibliography\n\nRelevance\nStudents often ask me how to compile a quality bibliography. First, what is a “quality bibliography”? Let’s say you’re writing an article on the novela negra of the past decade. You will want to cite: * foundational texts (relevant work on detective fiction in general, definitions of the novela negra mode) * pertinent literary criticism about the particular novela(s) negra(s) you are analyzing * theory and criticism related to your broader analytical framework * literature review: you may also need to cite/document other literary texts in the novela negra tradition that establish a genealogy of sorts * historical or sociological works to situate your analysis in a particular context\n\n\nOptimizing Your Search Terms on Google Scholar\nNotice that a recurring theme in those five bullet points is “relevance.” Unless you are analyzing a less-studied work, you won’t cite every single scholar that has written on the text. Instead, you’ll cite criticism that considers the work from a relevant angle. For instance, a Google Scholar search of Roberto Bolaño returns 15,100 results. However, if I search for Roberto Bolaño and “novela negra” (in quotation marks!), I have a more manageable 576 results. If I am particularly interested in treatments of his posthumous novel, and I add 2666 to the search query, I get 229 results. This is a much more useful number to search through.\n\n\nSearching Within Results\nHowever, there is an even better strategy in my estimation, which is beginning from the literary work at hand and working backward. One of my favorite techniques is to find a text (let’s stick with Bolaño’s 2666), and to “search within citing articles.” This means that, rather than just mentioning 2666 (for instance, in a literature review), the article/book at hand actually cites Bolaño’s novel. So, the first step is to search for Bolaño’s 2666 on Google Scholar and to click on “Cited by” under the Google entry: \nThe second step is to check the box for “search within citing articles” and then to enter the relevant term (“novela negra” in our case) in the search box: \nWhen I do this search, I get only 70 results that include the term “novela negra” and cite 2666. Bingo!:\n\nFrom there, I can select relevant articles to skim or read based on description (is it truly relevant?), quality of venue (is it peer reviewed?), numbers of citations (how important has the work been in subsequent scholarship?), etc. This is a first step toward compiling a comprehensive, high quality bibliography.\n\n\nMining Other Scholars’ Works Cited\nA second useful trick for finding good sources is to look at the bibliography of scholars that are working on topics similar to yours. If you are searching for theory and criticism related to detecive fiction, identify a respected scholar that has done the work before you. For instance, Glen S. Close and Persephone Braham have written excellent monographs on the topic, so the works cited sections of their books and articles will cite much of the important cultural and theoretical work on the detective genre. Even if you are working on, say, the Central American novela negra, their works cited will point you toward texts that may be useful for your project.\n\n\n\nLocating Difficult-to-Find Texts\n\nGetting Creative\nNow, to the cliffhanger. How did I locate the difficult-to-find text that my advisee was looking for? My student had already done good work in searching by title, author’s name, and book jacket description, so I knew I would have to dig deeper. I ended up searching for events where the author had given a book reading, and one of the events had an image of the book laying open on a table. I chose a sentence from the page and searched for it on Google with quotation marks. Basically, I did a reverse search for the book by citing something that I knew appeared in the text. That returned a side-by-side translation of the text from Spanish to English, which provided the entirety of the book’s content. The website where I found the novel was not turning up in the results for my student, because it was (perhaps unethically) listed as the work of the translator, not the original author. This type of let’s see what sticks search is something that is hard to explain, but will develop for you over time.\n\n\nOther strategies for locating a tough-to-find text\n\nSearch for the book on Amazon and, if a preview is available (“Look Inside”), you can search for terms and see a snippet of the text.\nSimilarly, Google Books will often allow limited page views or snippet view of texts. I use this when I am revising quotations for books that I no longer possess (say I returned it to the library but am doing an R&R).\nRelated to Google Books, I find that different countries have different agreements with Google in terms of if there is a preview of the text (snippet or full page) and how many pages one can view. In my experience, US Google books (https://books.google.com) has more texts available for preview than Canada (https://books.google.ca), so I search in both of them.\nMany publishers post the full text of introductions to monographs on their websites. Introductions allow you to determine if a work is worth tracking down (ILL, purchasing, etc.)\nEven if a work is not open access, the bibliography/works cited is often viewable. This can provide inspiration for potentially relevant works to review.\nOnce you’ve exhausted all avenues, you can crowdsource your search in relevant social media groups. Different university libraries have access to different digital texts, and your fellow scholars may be willing to download and send you a text when you’re in a bind.\nAnd don’t forget the obvious: search the local public library, your university’s library catalog, and public repositories like academia.edu, Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg"

    "title": "Inviting Professors to Speak at your Event: Best practices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An undergraduate student approached me in Spring 2020 to give a 20-minute talk on Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities. He described the event and then told me that the talk was to take place… the following week. To his credit, after I explained why that timeline was impossible, the student asked me for advice on how to successfully and respectfully invite speakers for future events. I chatted with a few colleagues about their preferences and came up with the following guidelines.\nWhen possible, include the following in the invitation: * Date, time, location (with address), duration of entire event * Title and abstract of event (with link to website / facebook event page when possible) * Expectations: is it a formal talk? an informal roundtable? an open discussion? How long should the prof’s remarks be? 5-10 minutes? 20 minutes? * How strict is the format/content of the prof’s talk? In other words, are they free to speak about whatever they want or are you looking for a particular topic? * Will s/he present alone or will other participants be present? * Can/should s/he use a PPT, video, audio, etc.? * What other expectations are there? (In most events, a speaker just speaks and participates in a Q&A, and there is an organizer that facilitates the rest of the event). If you hope that the speaker will prepare something else (discussion questions, conversation facilitation, etc.), explicitly request that. Keep in mind: they may say no! * Is there a meal? Reception? * Will it be recorded? (they may request that their speech is not recorded) * Availability to meet or respond via email to answer questions, etc.\nIn the ideal scenario, you give your speaker(s) enough forewarning that you have not yet determined the precise date/time/location. In those instances, you are able to work around your speaker’s schedule.\n\nTiming\n\nGive ample forewarning. For a 10-minute talk, at least one month in advance. For a 20-to-30-minute talk, at least two months, but ideally longer.\nWhen events take place in non-business hours (after 5PM), things get tricky because professors have children, live off campus, etc. I conducted an informal survey of my colleagues at UBC and abroad, and they said for an after-hours event, they require a minimum of two months’ notice, because of arranging childcare and scheduling around other commitments and life.\nIf the event happens off campus, give more notice (2 months minimum).\nThe bottom line is, profs need plenty of warning, because we are busy. We teach classes, mentor graduate and undergraduate students, write books and articles, serve on myriad committees, and have private lives. So, aim for two months of notice to allow the prof to prepare a quality presentation.\n\nBelow is an invitation that I received in mid-February for an event in late March. As you’ll note in the first paragraph, the organizer had already informed me about the event (date, topic, length of talk) verbally in January. I have taken out specifics, but the form gives a good idea of what type of information should be provided to a speaker.\n\nDear Tamara,\nI know I mentioned this to you some time ago, but I have been remiss in following up. Here is more information about the event to mark X (specific thematic details).\nFirst, it will take place on DATE & TIME, in the Choi Centre at UBC.\nThe basic idea is to look back on the past forty years and identify some of the key elements of that history. There will also be contributions from SCHOLAR 1, ACTIVIST 2, POLITICIAN 3, and myself.\nI suggest that each of us speak for 5-10 minutes (no more than 10), and then open up a general discussion with the audience.\nThe event will also be accompanied by an exhibition from X.\nDo let me know if you have any questions."

    "title": "The Comprehensive Exam",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is for PhD students who are composing the reading lists for comprehensive exams. Below are tips and best practices from my experience and that mentors, colleagues, and students have shared with me.\nBefore considering general advice, it is important to remember two things. First, always check your program’s guidelines. There are many program-specific expectations, such as the number of texts that should be included on a reading list, the distribution of texts across each list, etc. Likewise, it is important to understand your supervisor’s expectations. S/he will provide instructions and guidance that no doubt align with the program’s expectations, but may also go beyond those. This is a good thing, as the program requirements are a minimum, but your supervisor has experience and knowledge that is (1) field specific and (2) tried and tested with other students.\n\nExam Reading Lists\n\nWhat are they? What are they for?\nIn my institution (French, Hispanic and Italian Studies at UBC), the comprehensive exam reading lists are meant to prepare students to be both a generalist in a broad field and a specialist in their chosen specific field. Composing the lists, reading the works, and completing the exam should move you toward a successful experience during the proposal phase of the PhD and, of course, contribute to the composition of the dissertation. The lists, prepared in consultation with the supervisor and committee, will necessarily be broader than the area covered by your dissertation, as they are comprised of both primary works and critical / theoretical texts that relate to your particular research interests, as well as an applicable wider context.\nThis broader context is important for a variety of reasons. First, you will be expected to teach outside of your specialty, and coursework and the comprehensive exams (as well as the MA) will contribute to making you a well-rounded scholar. Second, and most immediately pertinent, you must be able to situate your area of specialization in a broader context, to signal precursors, formal innovations, and literary dialogues. Finally, you will eventually need to articulate a second project (once you have that tenure-track position and are making progress on turning the dissertation into a book manuscript!), and having a basis in a broader context will help you make inroads on thinking about that second monograph.\nComposing the lists requires students to understand their research interests and have a general sense of where the dissertation is going (I purposely put that in the present progressive… the dissertation is already cooking when you’re at the comprehensive exam stage!). The lists will also take various rounds of revisions between you and your supervisor, and then you and your committee members. This can be frustrating, but it’s part of the process, and ideally you will better understand how projects coalesce as a result of the process. Most importantly, having solid lists that relate to your future project will facilitate each of the subsequent stages (proposal, dissertation, monograph).\n\n\nBefore You Start\n\n#1 Rule: check your program-specific guidelines and your supervisor’s expectations.\nKnow the topic of each list (at my institution these are “general” and “specific” fields + critical texts/theory), how many works should be on each list, what the exam will look like, and the timeline and pertinent deadlines for your program.\nRequest examples of successful reading lists from your program. You should check with the Graduate Studies Director, who can provide you with examples or direct you to students who might be willing to share their lists.\nBefore you begin composing the lists, you should be able to articulate your research interests and define the tentative direction the dissertation will take. Some questions you should be able to answer: What time period and region / countries do you plan to study? What are the primary critical / theoretical disciplines you will engage with? Who are some of the principle authors you will write about? What are the genres / literary movements that interest you? What methodological approaches will your research entail?\nIf you are reading this entry early in your PhD journey, begin thinking about how your coursework may be completed so as to be useful for the dissertation. For instance, if you have flexibility to choose the topic / texts of a final paper, select something that you may want to work on during the dissertation. If you’re lucky, you might even walk away from coursework with an early version of a chapter.\nI encourage my students to think about potential dissertation chapters as early as possible and, to the best of their ability, to write tentative chapter abstracts as soon as topics and research questions emerge. These chapter abstracts may be very schematic and will likely change through the proposal phase and dissertation writing. However, having a tentative idea of what your chapters will look like will help you see through-lines emerge in your research interests and may point you in the direction of what type of theoretical texts and literary criticism will be useful for your project. You may have a clear idea about one chapter, a vague notion of two other chapters, and no idea what will go in the final 1-2 chapters, but keeping what you do know in mind at this early stage will help you begin putting together your lists and defining your framework.\n\n\n\nCompiling Your Lists\n\nSee the entry, “Compiling a High-Quality Bibliography” for my tips on how I locate and select secondary / critical texts.\nAlthough reading list composition is primarily your task as the student, seek input from your committee chair regularly.\nChat with other graduate students, particularly those who worked with your committee members, to hear about their experience and solicit advice.\nFor primary texts, I encourage students to include both canonical and lesser known works. This will ensure that you are participating in important scholarly conversations, but also bringing something new to the table.\nThe secondary readings (literary criticism, theory) should be primarily comprised of works written in the past twenty years, although you will absolutely need relevant canonical works. You should be able to demonstrate knowledge of major trends across time and current debates in recent years (state of the field).\nAlthough it may be tempting to include many texts that you have already read, think of comps as a chance to read widely and expand your knowledge free from other obligations (I recognize you will likely be working as a TA or RA, but you are not yet writing the dissertation). The more texts you have read on your topic as you begin the dissertation writing process, the better off you will be. That said, being strategic is also important and graduating is the first step to getting a job. In short, balance is key.\nOnce your chair approves your lists and communicates that they are ready to be revised by the committee, send the members a copy and request their feedback.\nSpeak with your committee members individually or collectively to clarify any ambiguous or confusing feedback.\nSome questions to ask yourself before sending the list for review by your chair/committee: Do I include an array voices (women, authors of colour, queer writers, etc.) in all three lists? In terms of theoretical texts, what schools am I including (North American, European, Latin American, Indigenous, etc.)? Are there any major debates from the time period that I have forgotten? Can I articulate why I choose these texts and why I excluded others?\n\n\n\nHow to Study and Prepare for the Exam\nStudying and preparing for your comps is necessarily an individual process. However, here are some tried and true practices that may help you prepare. * Be organized and have a system. Start a Google Doc or keep a notebook. Take notes as you read. Make succinct summaries of works. Include keywords. Have a highlighting system. * I kept notecards with important details, major themes and formal devices, keywords, and relevant dates. I’d flip through these notecards on commutes or when killing time before meetings. * Save entries in MLA style (or whatever formatting style you agree on with your supervisor). Having a well formatted bibliography is key to presenting your work as polished and professional. These should be fully formatted each time you submit your lists to your supervisor or committee (messy lists are less likely to be approved). * Request examples of past comps questions to understand what kind of questions are asked. Check with the Graduate Studies Director. * Create practice questions for yourself. Begin putting primary texts into dialogue with one another, with the literary tradition, with your critical texts, etc. * Some members of my PhD cohort dictated oral notes that they then converted to searchable text via a transcription program. * As you read, attend to key debates in your fields. You will recognize these debates as topics that emerge across critical works and that are at the centre of scholarly conversations. You should be able to rehearse critical debates and articulate your opinion on where you stand in relation to other scholars. * Remember that the exam is NOT an end in itself. It is meant to prepare you for the proposal stage and dissertation writing. You should take notes about possible chapter topics, what literary works would pair well with particular critical texts, ideas for the introduction, common threads in the different literary texts, etc. The more notes you have in this regard, the quicker the proposal and dissertation should come together!\n\n\nFHIS-specific Advice\nAfter chatting with colleagues at UBC, here is advice meant specifically for students in FHIS * Regarding the number of texts on each list, this is a common format: 1) General Field: 40 works; Minor Field: 20-25 works; Theory: 15-20 works. But the distribution is flexible. * The major field identifies the principal field of interest in terms of geography (national and/or global terms), time frame, and maybe further criteria such as genre, approach, movement, specific theoretical framework, etc. * The minor field identifies the specifics of the dissertation sub field, homing in on particularities within the major field. The minor field could be creative. * For both composing the lists and for the actual exam, it is wise to focus on the relational aspects of the two fields, how they dialogue, intersect, diverge, etc. * In terms of thinking about what makes for a solid exam performance, it is difficult to say exactly, however, here are some good characteristics to keep in mind: Breadth of knowledge and specificity. Development of a coherent argument in each essay. How well you know and engage with the lists. How well you apply the theoretical texts to the primary works. How well you address the questions posed. * In terms of format of the exam, FHIS students receive 3 possible questions (created by the student’s Exam Committee) and must respond to two of these essays over the course of 2 weeks. Each essay should be around 5000 words. The committee then reads the essays and a 1-hour oral defence is scheduled.\n(Many thanks in particular to Professors Kim Beauchesne and Alessandra Santos for sharing their wisdom for this section!)\n\n\nThe Day of the Exam\nMy PhD program (Indiana) had a one-day exam in which students wrote two essays (selected from 4 options) in two 4-hour blocks. If that is the format of your exam, here are some tips for how to best prepare yourself for writing your one-day comps. * Although reviewing material may be useful (and might help calm your nerves), try not to read anything new the day before and the day of your comps. Relax, eat well, get some rest. * On the day of the exam, eat a good breakfast, stay hydrated, and bring snacks to the exam. I had a whole kit with Advil, water, snacks, earplugs, gum, tissues, rubberbands to pull my hair back… basically anything that I thought I might want. This kept me calm and kept my energy up. * If your exam occurs during the academic year and you are working as a TA or an RA, let your supervising professor know about the exam and request the day before, of, and after the exam off. Ideally, this will not an issue, as your Department should be invested in your success and well-being. (If you are a TA, it would be wise to make sure that your exam does not fall on a week when your supervising prof does need you) * When you begin your exam, read the questions slowly and at least twice before beginning to respond. MAKE SURE YOU RESPOND TO THE QUESTION POSED. Not tightly responding to the question asked is one of the primarily reasons that students might fail an exam.\n A trip down memory lane: Colour-coded notecards from Tamara’s comps.\n\n\nYour Comps\nEach student’s experience with comps will differ based on their particular interests, their study habits, their relationship with the supervisor and committee, etc. The advice here is meant to be a general resource, but you no doubt will (and should!) develop your own approach to both composing and preparing for comps. Comps can be a stressful experience, but, in the best of circumstances, this should be an exciting stage of the PhD, as you should be principally dedicated to becoming familiar with foundational works related to your research interests and developing the project that will become the dissertation."

    "text": "NOTE: A condensed version of this article was published on The Humanities in Transition.\nThese are just a few of the end-of-semester comments that undergraduate and graduate students expressed to me following the transition to remote learning. I immediately recognized what my students were communicating as something that I, too, was dealing with: screen fatigue.\nIn addition to visual and mental exhaustion from staring at screens, many people studying and working from home due to the pandemic are experiencing physical discomfort associated with sitting at a desk for prolonged hours. My students have likewise expressed dissatisfaction with how much time they sit immobile in front of their computers—again, I can relate.\nIn an effort to protect the health of students, faculty, and staff, the University of British Columbia, where I teach, has announced that, other than courses that require in-person instruction (e.g., film production and music), classes will be completely remote in the fall. As I prepare for another semester of online teaching, I am taking to heart the above feedback and adapting my pedagogy in response to screen fatigue and inactivity. To do so, I draw from two practices that have gone hand-in-hand for millennia: learning and wandering."

    "section": "The Virtues of Walking Around",
    "text": "The Virtues of Walking Around\nFrom Charles Baudelaire’s flâneur to Henry David Thoreau’s “art of walking,” from the Situationalists’ psychogeography to W.G. Sebald’s walk along the Suffolk coast, wandering has been held as a font of aesthetic inspiration in the creative process and as an act that contains the seed of revolutionary potential. Friedrich Nietzsche held walking as vital to the task of philosophy, writing “Only thoughts which come from walking have any value” (62). This esteem for one of the simplest forms of human transport goes back to Aristotle, whose disciples formed part of the Peripatetic School. Meaning “given to walking about” (“Peripatetic”), this concept relates both to the columned walkways of the Lyceum where Aristotle taught in Athens and to his storied reputation for walking around while teaching.\nWalking has also been important in my discipline: Latin American literature.\nManuel Maples Arce, leader of the avant-garde movement Estridentismo (Stridentism) in early-twentieth-century Mexico, insisted that art and aesthetic inspiration are derived from “the sensory stimuli of urban experience” (Flores 211). Later, Chilean poet and diplomat Pablo Neruda penned “Walking Around” in the midst of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). With surrealist images, such as the juxtaposition of umbrellas, venom, and umbilical cords (verse 39), Neruda’s poetic voice confronts the violence of modernity and the desperation of the human condition while walking through an urban setting.\nNone of these intellectuals were particularly attuned to how differently abled people wander, which can take many forms. It’s more about moving through space and attending to one’s environment than walking per se. The benefits of such wandering go far beyond aesthetic inspiration.\nStudies have shown that moving through both natural and urban spaces increases “creative ideation” (Oppezzo and Schwartz), boosts attention span (Tine and Butler), improves short-term and long-term knowledge retention (Weight et al.), and generates a sense of emotional wellbeing (Ettema and Smajic).\nIn the context of the pandemic, moderate exercise is doubly important, given that overall health is harmed by inactivity. A pervasive health consequence of recent social distancing measures is a rise in the incidence of protracted sedentariness, which results in lowered levels of Vitamin D. This is detrimental to COVID-19 patients, who are more likely to have severe reactions to the disease when they suffer from Vitamin D deficiency, as well as to people who do not contract COVID-19, given that long-term health may be adversely affected by prolonged inactivity (Carter et al. 1-2).\nApart from these lofty philosophical and scientific justifications, after months of self-isolation to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we could all benefit from some fresh air and wandering."

    "text": "Learning in the Time of COVID-19\nI teach Latin American literatures and cultures, so, in addition to brief lectures that contextualize readings and provide tools for literary analysis, my class sessions are chock full of small-group and whole-class discussions. When classes were moved online in mid-March, my principal goal was to avoid deploying new technologies, as I worried that students were learning new apps and platforms for multiple classes.\nTo that end, I recorded brief lectures (~10 minutes) over PowerPoint presentations and asked students to participate in Canvas discussion forums. This solution closely mimicked our prior in-class format, and students seemed satisfied with this approach.\nI also sought feedback from students regarding how to make their unanticipated remote learning more meaningful. One suggestion was that I allow them to record oral reflections about class material instead of writing up responses for the discussion forum. Students noted that this would allow them to record on their phones—away from their computer screens—as well as to practice their spoken Spanish.\nLittle did I know that this practice would be valuable in other ways. Permitting recordings opened up a different form of reflection that was more creative—closer to the freewheeling discussions we had held in class. Students’ oral observations had a productive, meandering quality that was often more spontaneous than written responses while still thoughtful and rigorous.\nAs I prepare my courses for the upcoming academic year, I plan to encourage similar creative meandering that also allows students to reflect on course material away from their computer screens."

    "section": "Wandering and/as Learning",
    "text": "Wandering and/as Learning\nGiven that classes will not meet on campus, many students will not have access to a printer, so I recognize that they will spend a significant amount of time completing required readings on electronic devices. Likewise, all discussion sections and office hours will necessarily take place online. This means that course lectures and assignments will provide the greatest flexibility in terms of allowing students time away from their devices.\nSerendipitously, this past spring I debuted a Latin American Studies course that incorporated podcasting as a learning outcome, so I am newly familiar with the sound editing software Audacity. I plan to put these new skills to use by preparing lectures as podcast episodes, which will be available for streaming and download on the course blog and Canvas (the learning management system used at UBC).\nI will encourage students to listen to each episode away from their computer screens. This will not only combat screen fatigue but will also permit students to, ideally, learn on the move. In fact, one of my central objectives in designing both lectures and course assessments will be encouraging students to get outside—while practicing appropriate safety precautions and social distancing, of course—in order to listen to and reflect on course material.\nIn addition to the health benefits and positive learning outcomes listed above, listening to lectures while spending time on the move opens up possibilities for fieldwork and ethnographic observation. The course I am teaching in the fall relates to Indigenous foodways in Latin America, and two of the assignments ask students to take observational strolls, during which they consider local foodways and food practices in relation to the material they are learning in readings and podcast lectures.\nIn the first assignment, students will be asked to undertake a comparative analysis of their local food environment with that of one of the Latin American communities we study. As an example, one unit considers food deserts and the ways in which globalization and urban planning affect food security. Students will attend to the availability or scarcity of food in their own communities alongside this material.\nThe second assignment asks students to identify an instance of ayni, the Quechua practice of sacred reciprocity and mutualism among people and the earth. Ayni is sometimes translated as “today for me, tomorrow for you” (Villoldo), and it relates to giving without the expectation of receiving a corresponding “payment” in return. Instead, the culture of reciprocity means that, for instance, “today, you give me vegetables, because my crops died” and “tomorrow, I give you timber to fix your leaking roof.” Recent scholarship has shown that ayni contributes to food sovereignty, biodiversity, and food security in barter markets organized by Quechua peoples of the Peruvian Andes (Argumedo and Pimbert). Students will look for an act in their local food communities that reflects the spirit of ayni. This could be as ambitious as food exchanges that form part of a mutual aid organization or as simple as a bird feeder.\nBoth of these assignments make the best of the exceptional situation wrought by the coronavirus and remote learning. Given that my students will be spread out across the world, their observations and comparisons will be uniquely disparate in a way that could not occur if we were meeting together on campus. This puts a positive spin on remote learning and allows us to take advantage of learning together while far apart.\nThis task of “wandering” may look quite different for each student, as they may have different physical capabilities, disparate surroundings, and diverse restrictions related to social distancing measures. In every circumstance, I will encourage my students to meet with me to discuss what “wandering” will look like for them, and I will be flexible for students who prefer or require an adjusted assignment.\nIn Wanderlust: A History of Walking, Rebecca Solnit observes that “Walking itself is the intentional act closest to the unwilled rhythms of the body, to breathing and the beating of the heart. It strikes a delicate balance between working and idling, being and doing. It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals” (5). My approach to online teaching seeks to facilitate such thoughts, arrivals, and experiences through a semester of wandering, both aimless and purposeful."

    "text": "Equitable and Inclusive Learning\nSimilar to many podcasts, I will prepare a landing page (like this one by 99% Invisible) for each episode with lecture notes, images, and links to pertinent online resources and secondary readings. While students may get away from their computer screens to listen to the podcast lecture, this differentiated instruction style will be more equitable for myriad reasons.\nFirst, UBC students will be taking courses from across the world, and asynchronous lectures will be equally convenient across time zones. Furthermore, asynchronous lectures allow students to take in information at their own pace. And students with complicated home situations—perhaps they have small children or many roommates that share common spaces—may access recordings when it is optimal for their learning.\nSecond, the scripted nature of a podcast means that each lecture will already have an accompanying transcript, which will be posted on the landing page. The transcript, online materials, and graphics will facilitate learning for visual learners as well as students with hearing impairments.\nThird, students have widely different technological resources at home. Now that students will not have access to campus computer labs and university Wi-Fi, I cannot guarantee that typing up assignments, downloading hefty PowerPoint files, or viewing streaming lectures will be equally feasible for all students. By providing podcast lectures and mobile-friendly landing pages, students learning on smartphones will have an easier time accessing material. Likewise, students will be given the option of typing or recording weekly assignments, which allows maximum flexibility for students who do not have easy access to a computer.\nFinally, leveraging podcasts as a pedagogical tool will allow me to incorporate Indigenous voices in a way that traditional course lectures would not. For instance, I will include the Toasted Sister Podcast interview with Neftalí Duran in the unit on Indigenous migration and diaspora. In this way, students will hear from a Mixteco chef and be prompted to consider course topics alongside the lived experience of Latin American people."

    "text": "The Humanities Moving Forward\nThe precipitous shift to remote teaching and learning due to the pandemic has not always been a seamless process. However, in many cases, it has encouraged instructors to experiment with diverse technologies, to have conversations with colleagues and students about teaching strategies, and to purposefully revisit pedagogical endeavors with an open mind.\nMy hope is that these pedagogical practices allow humanities scholars to become nimbler at incorporating new technologies into research dissemination in a meaningful way, and I am optimistic that this unanticipated year of online teaching may effect that change. Educators have been fairly open to utilizing new media, applications, and platforms in teaching during the pandemic, and an ideal outcome would be that researchers are therefore more equipped to convey their scholarly findings across different media and in different registers.\nIdeally, this would also allow researchers to train humanities students in new technologies, so that humanists graduate with greater digital literacy to complement the rigorous training in critical thinking, literary analysis, language proficiency, and research methodologies that we already provide."

    "section": "Tips for Podcast Lectures",
    "text": "Tips for Podcast Lectures\nIf you’re interested in peripatetic pedagogy, here are some tips to get started.\n\nContent tips:\n\nBe less formal than you might in a traditional lecture. This is a more conversational register. Emoting is also a plus for listener engagement.\nSentences should be shorter (no longer than one breath—you don’t want to inhale mid-sentence).\nKeep the podcast lectures shorter than a typical class period. I aim for 20 minutes per lecture.\nRecord one intro and one outro, and reuse those across your lecture episodes. This will give continuity to the content and save you lots of time across the semester.\nBranch out with podcast format. For instance, you might invite an expert to do a guest lecture or join you for an interview.\nBe mindful of intellectual property concerns. If you don’t want the podcast lectures to become available to the public, make sure to post them behind a login. On this note, check your university’s policy about who owns the pedagogical resources you create for your classes.\nIf you do post them publicly, take care to consider copyright laws while selecting music for your podcast. This site provides legal guidance and has links to free music.\nAsk your students for feedback after you’ve delivered 3-4 lectures.\n\n\n\nTechnology tips:\n\nRecord in a quiet room with little ambient noise.\nConsider borrowing an external USB microphone to improve the sound quality. Check with your university and public library for equipment rentals (they often rent them for free).\nYou can also record voice notes on your smartphone, which have a higher quality than computer speakers. I used this one before I purchased a microphone.\nKeep the landing page simple. You can use a free blogging platform, like WordPress, to host your site. Then you simply create a blog entry for each lecture. Copy and paste the transcript as it is, and then include links, photos, and videos that enhance the transcript.\nEdit the metadata on each track so that the lectures will be organized when your students download them.\nPerfectionism is not your friend. These are not NPR-ready podcasts, so you do not have to edit relentlessly and do multiple takes to get perfect content.\nIf you have a question, Google it. Many brilliant instructors have done this before and shared advice online. Take advantage of their generosity and experience."

My research is animated by questions of political agency, economic precarity, and the violence that obtains throughout waning national modernity, as well as by the ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes burgeoning neoliberal globalization.\nMy dissertation analyzed the novels of Chilean-Mexican-Catalunyan author Roberto Bolaño and Honduran-Salvadoran-US-Latino author Horacio Castellanos Moya as a means of conceptualizing the rise of what I call “post-national literature,” which refers to literary works that comment on and critique, both formally and thematically, the shifting dynamics of the nation state as neoliberal globalization becomes the dominant ordering system of world relations. To do this, I analyzed these authors’ engagements with literary and aesthetic traditions, particularly realism and the avant-garde, to demonstrate that a dialectic emerges between their works and the literary past that opens a space to interrogate the place of aesthetic praxis as neoliberal globalization becomes ascendant. Finally, I examined Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s literary rejections of Leftist militant reason and discussed how their novels offer an internal critique of the Left’s complicity in the rise of neoliberal globalization.\nMy current book project, Novel Crises: Neoliberalism, Post-Nationalism, and Mexican and Central American Literature, examines contemporary novels that represent and respond to burgeoning neoliberal globalization. In it, I read late-20th and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction—produced both domestically and in the diaspora—to two ends. First, I attend to the ways in which, with a distinctly neoliberal aesthetic, each work meditates on and denaturalizes the notion of “national” literatures. Second, I situate each novel in relation to the literary tradition that precedes it, and I consider how political and economic upheaval is accompanied by a related literary crisis. To this end, Novel Crises asks: If the novel is the genre par excellence of national modernity, what becomes of this literary form as neoliberal economic relations come to replace the nation state? In different ways, each of the novels that I examine poses this question, narrating not only the economic and biopolitical crises of the neoliberal present, but also recognizing their own status as works in crisis. I read novels by Roberto Bolaño, Laury Leite, Valeria Luiselli, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Claudia Hernández, and Carol Zardetto as post-national narratives, and I attend to the ways in which politics, economics, ethics, and aesthetics become entangled in these works. Along the way, my project engages with diverse theoretical perspectives, such as Critical Race Theory, Migration and Diaspora Studies, continental philosophy, and Sound Studies.\nI am working on a second book project, tentatively titled Sounds of the Capitalocene: Violence and Aurality in Latin American Narrative Fiction, that considers how 20th- and 21st-century authors turn to aurality in narrative fiction as a means of critiquing and responding to exclusionary politics, economic inequalities, gendered violence, and ecological devastation of the neoliberal present. In it, I read fiction by authors such as Ana Castillo, Yuri Herrera, Emiliano Monge, Guadalupe Nettel, Juan Villoro, and Augustín Yáñez, whose work, I argue, engages with sound, silence, and listening as a means of grappling with the inequalities and cruelty of advanced capitalism."

    "title": "Natalia Beristáin, Rosario Castellanos and Violence Against Women",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At a January 2020 screening of Los adioses, I was invited to give a talk on the work of director Natalia Beristáin. The below is a transcript of that talk.\n\nLa violencia es microscópica… Y también es macro.\n\nThis quotation serves as a sort of through-line in the films of Natalia Beristáin, director of Los adioses, whose creative work I will briefly discuss today in relation to the contemporary social and political situation in Mexico. Shortly, I will return to the above quotation.\nBeristáin is the director of two feature length films—2017’s Los adioses, and 2012’s No quiero dormir sola—as well as multiple short films, including Peces plátano and “La evocación.” Her work is highly regarded, having been nominated for and receiving various prestigious awards.\nLike Lucía Carreras, Lila Avilés, and Natalia Almada, Beristáin is in a class of Mexican filmmakers whose work is concerned with contemporary social issues, such as racism, class inequalities, mental illness, and the drug war. Similar to Almada, Beristáin often deploys a reserved aesthetic, employing sustained shots and unsettling framing to provoke tension and create a pensive narrative atmosphere.\nBeristáin’s films focalize complicated present-day social concerns. No quiero dormir sola is a measured reflection on aging and dementia, told through the prism of a multigenerational relationship between two women of the Mexico City artistic class. The film subtly exposes violence against the elderly, a lack of understanding and compassion for the frailties of old age, and a failing social system that cannot take care of its aging population—a crisis that has become a global reality.\nThe short, “La evocación”, is the final part of the anthology film, La habitación, which narrates historical moments in Mexico from the time of Porfirio Díaz to the present. Eight episodes depict different stories that unfold across time in the same room. “La evocación” is the only installment of the film directed by a woman, and the part centers on vulnerable populations, such as victims of domestic violence, the homeless, drug addicts, and orphaned children, who find refuge and a support system in the titular room.\nAs these brief synopses show, Beristáin’s creative work is often socially engaged, and the most salient recurring theme is, without a doubt, violence against women.\n\nLa violencia es microscópica… Y también es macro.\n\nThese words are stated by an unnamed woman discussing her experience of gendered violence in Mexico City in the 2019 documentary short, Nosotras, which Beristáin directed. In the short film, a dozen women give testimony about domestic violence, gendered micro aggressions, and femicide in Mexico. Femicide is defined as the murder of a woman based on her condition as a woman, “the murders of women and girls founded on a gender power structure” (Fregoso and Bejarano 5), and Mexico has one of the highest rates of femicide in Latin America. Violence against women has escalated in recent decades due to increased poverty, the flexibilization of labor, and migration, often effects of neoliberal economic policies. This precarious socioeconomic situation in combination with a traditionally patriarchal culture often proves deadly for women in Mexico.\nWhich brings me back to Los adioses. When I first heard about the film, I thought “No! Don’t soil my feminist hero with a torrid love story.” I still remember the first time I read Castellanos’s “Lección de cocina,” which contains the bitter musings of a newly minted housewife who did not realize that marriage meant trading in her books on philosophy for cookbooks. In Los adioses, we hear pieces of “The Cooking Lesson” in a voiceover the first time that marital bliss begins to dissolve in the film and Ricardo intrudes on Rosario’s writing. Los adioses is a reminder that being a feminist does not prevent a woman from confronting machismo at home.\n\nLa violencia es microscópica… Y también es macro.\n\nTo my mind, one of the most productive overlaps between Castellanos’s and Beristáin’s creative work are the ways in which their projects problematize their own privileged social status. Whether this is a conscious effort or an ideological blind spot is debatable, but both women’s work opens up a productive space to consider questions of privilege in the world of representation.\nCastellanos’s “The Cooking Lesson,” for instance, presents a complex portrait of an upper-middle class woman who, in one and the same thought wants to shed the domestic role forced upon her while also speaking wistfully of servants who are free to “switch masters” at will. Similarly, Beristáin’s No quiero dormir sola asks the viewer to feel pity for the aging grandmother, whose wealthy son and her past as a successful actress secure her space in a swanky retirement home exclusively for Mexico City’s “artistes.” This is the prism through which Beristáin problematizes an infrastructure that is ill-equipped for a rapidly aging population.\nIn closing, despite eliding some of Castellano’s major commitments–such as her activism for indigenous communities–Beristáin does a credible job of depicting the complexities of Castellanos’s life as evidenced in her publications, private letters, and public lectures. The film makes palpable the difficulty of reconciling a militant feminist ideology with the warring desire to build a life with a partner whose values are decidedly anti-feminist.\n\nWorks referenced & Links of interest\n\nhttp://www.luxboxfilms.com/los-adioses-1\nhttps://revista192.com/natalia-beristain/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CmPWcRUaFY\nhttp://www.elojoquepiensa.cucsh.udg.mx/index.php/elojoquepiensa/article/view/171/175\nhttps://soundsandcolours.com/reviews/film-reviews/los-adioses-40849/\nhttps://gatopardo.com/arte-y-cultura/directoras-de-cine-mexicano/\nhttps://www.revistadelauniversidad.mx/articles/4167e7ff-acee-49cc-888b-349ba2e7f198/por-amor-al-arte"

    "title": "Locating New Primary Sources",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the Summer of 2021, I worked with two undergraduate research assistants on a new project related to Central American narrative, for which I was particularly invested in identifying contemporary Guatemalan and U.S.-Guatemalan women writers. That mentorship relationship required that, for the first time, I had to articulate how I locate promising new primary sources for my research. Until that point, I’d never taken note of most of the tricks and tactics I use to find new novels and other pertinent literary works. The exercise turned out to be somewhat surprising, as I didn’t realize how often I turned to informal sources, such as social media or Amazon suggestions, to find relevant works. Below you’ll find the strategies that I shared with with my RAs at the start of the summer.\n\nThe Obvious Tricks\n\nGoogle\nLiterary Scholars: As you search, remember that, outside of literary studies, “literature” relates broadly to studies written on a particular topic, so using “literature / literatura” may not return specific enough results. To get around this, I use terms like “fiction,” “novels,” “narrative fiction,” “narrative work,” “novelist,” etc. * 1. Be both obvious and clever with your search terms (novela guatemalteca, novela Guatemala, libro centroamericano, autora guatemalteca, escritora chapina, Central American fiction, novela feminista Guatemala). Remember to try terms both free of quotation marks, as well as with quotation marks. (See the compiling a quality bib post for tips on optimizing your search terms) * 2. Once you’ve identified your search terms, perform a typical Google search, but also search in Google Scholar. * 3. Google in both English and Spanish.\n\n\nThe Library\nThis will sound obvious to many, but perhaps not as much to scholars who were trained in the age of Google: Visiting the physical library is one of the best ways to stumble across interesting new texts. * 4. Stop by the section with Central American authors you know (e.g., Claudia Hernández) and browse the area to discover new authors. * 5. Navigate to academic databases (JSTOR, Project Muse) or journals (Chasqui, Revista de Estudios Hispánicos) and input your search terms (#1 above) to find pertienent secondary resources. * 6. The library website is a fantastic resource for locating new primary texts. For instance, clicking into a search result for a novel by Nicaraguan author Gioconda Belli allows me to click on topics, such as “Central America–Fiction,” which may reveal other pertinent authors.\n\n\n\nMining Bibliographies\n\n\nCheck out the authors included in relevant anthologies, such as The Wandering Song: Central America Writing in the United States, or those included in encyclopedic volumes, like Literatura Centroamericana. Diccionarios de autores contemporáneos, edited by Jorge Eduardo Arellano.\n\n\nReview the bibliographies of publications penned by scholars working in your area. Even if a particular article is on an author that you are already familiar with, sometimes, as part of the lit review, scholars will mention other writers that are contemporary to the author the article is about.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess Obvious Tricks\n\nRelated searches & Website Recommendations\n\n\nGoodReads: Search for a Guatemalan author you know (Carol Zardetto, Miguel Ángel Asturias) and see what additional authors are suggested as “similar books.”\n\n\nAmazon.com: Same as above. Search for a Guatemalan author you know, and scroll down to see “Frequently bought together” and “Customers who viewed this item also viewed.”\n\n\nBrowse the catalogues of presses that publish authors similar to those you are interested in reading. For instance, if you know a publisher that prints titles by women from the region you are interested in (such as Alfaguara, it is likely that they have additional women authors that may be of interest.\n\n\nOn Google, search for an author you know who is similar (demographic, geographically, topic, etc.) to what you are looking for. For instance, if you are hoping to identify contemporary Guatemalan-American writers, you might search for “Francisco Goldman.” From there, check out news articles, literary reviews, ReMezcla articles, scholarly pieces, etc. that mentions Goldman to see if other similar novelists are noted or suggested in the piece.\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\nJoin groups on Facebook and follow authors and scholars on Twitter that are related to your topic. Browse old posts/tweets to see what authors are mentioned.\n\n\nSee who relevant people are following on social media. Twitter is especially useful for this. For instance, if you’re interested in the subgroup of Central American (or Central American American) writers who pen both journalism and non-fiction, you might navigate to Óscar Martínez’s or Héctor Tobar’s profiles and browse who they are following.\n\n\nFinally, you might also create a tweet or Facebook post that asks people for input, but I typically wait until I’ve done significant initial research before farming out my inquiry.\n\n\nThanks to the efforts of my brilliant research assistants, I have now read fiction by Anabella Giracca, Denise Phé-Funchal, Valeria Cerezo, and Ivanna Chapeta, among many other Guatemalan authors that I wasn’t previously familiar with."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My students often ask for advice on preparing for the job market, so I compiled this PDF based on my experience on the job market in 2018-19, but updated in 2022 to account for changes since the COVID-19 pandemic. I study Latin American literature, and some of the advice I provide is fairly discipline specific, but you can easily adjust the recommendations to fit your field.\nThere are myriad wonderful sites and resources for graduate students looking to enter a career in academia. I suggest you check out different opinions, because there is not one correct path for getting a job. As always, if anything here contradicts your advisor(s), ignore me and listen to him/her/them.\nHere is a 2020 entry in The Professor Is In that is particularly relevant to this topic: “What Are Candidates Doing Wrong (crowdsourced responses from recent search committee members)”\nFinally, if you’re reading this early in your PhD, check out this column by Karen Kelsky (of The Professor Is In), “Graduate School is a Means to a Job.” Presumably, you are pursuing a PhD in literary studies with a particular goal in mind, and that goal is likely to land a tenure-track job to teach and conduct research in your field. This means that you should be strategic and, in my experience, a little bit cynical. Kelsky agrees, stating: &gt; As a graduate student, your fate is in your own hands, and every decision you make—including whether to go to graduate school at all, which program to go to, which adviser to choose, and how to conduct yourself while there—can and should be made with an eye to the job you wish to have at the end. &gt; &gt; To do otherwise is pure madness. I have no patience whatsoever with the ‘love’ narrative (we do what we do because we love it and money/jobs play no role) that prevails among some advisers, departments, and profoundly mystified graduate students."
