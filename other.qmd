## COVID work

* Delphi Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University
    - [Website](https://delphi.cmu.edu)
    - [Covidcast](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/)
    - [Github Org](http://github.com/cmu-delphi)

* [BC COVID-19 Modelling Group](https://bccovid-19group.ca)

* [BC COVID Case Tracker](bc-covid-tracker/), somewhat useless now that cases are dramatically underreported, but still running.


## R packages for recent papers and publications

(See [github/dajmcdon](http://github.com/dajmcdon) or my
  [publications page](/publications/) for others)
  
* [{fkf}](https://waternumbers.github.io/FKF/index.html): __Fast Kalman Filter.__
  Very fast Kalman filtering and smoothing. 
* [{sparsegl}](https://dajmcdon.github.io/sparsegl/) __Sparse Group Lasso.__
    Efficient implementation of sparse group lasso with optional bound constraints on the coefficients. It supports the use of a sparse design matrix as well as returning coefficient estimates in a sparse matrix. Furthermore, it correctly calculates the degrees of freedom to allow for information criteria rather than cross-validation with very large data. Finally, the interface to compiled code avoids unnecessary copies and allows for the use of long integers.
* [{dpf}](http://github.com/dajmcdon/dpf): __Discrete particle
  filtering.__ This package greedily estimates switching Kalman filters
  *fast*. Also useful for analysis of musical tempos.
* [{AIMER}](http://github.com/dajmcdon/aimer): __Amplified, Initially Marginal, Eigenvector Regression.__ As described in Ding, L. and McDonald, D.J.,
"Predicting phenotypes from microarrays using amplified, initially
marginal, eigenvector regression". A better version of supervised
principal components analysis.
* [{cplr}](http://github.com/dajmcdon/cplr): __Compressed penalized linear regression.__ As described in Homrighausen, D. and McDonald, D.J.,
"Compressed and penalized linear regression." 


## Additional resources

* [Advice for getting a job](/assets/code-links/marketadvice.pdf), somewhat out of date
* [Minimal make files](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/)
* [Nice LaTeX tables](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf)

### Resources for R and basic analysis

(see also my course materials on the [Teaching](/teaching/) page)

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), a nice textbook from Hadley Wickham
* [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com), good exposition on setting up and combining R and Git
* [Basic text mining in R](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/265713_cbef910aee7642dc8b62996e38d2825d.html)
* [Fix common Github+R issues](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#rpostback-askpass-error), the dreaded rpostback askpass error
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
* [The batchtools package](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/index.html) for easy cluster parallelization

## Artwork and other attributions

The artwork throughout this website is generated using R and additional packages. In principle, it will change randomly whenever the site is updated. Some of these use the [aRtsy](https://koenderks.github.io/aRtsy/index.html) package built by Koen Derks. Others use some custom functions that I occasionally work on in my spare time. These have benefited from reading Danielle Navarro's excellent [blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/#category=Art) and other material, as well as some posts by [Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields). 

This website was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) along with some custom CSS inspired by the [Hugo Apéro](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/contributors/) theme. Building the site in Quarto removes some flexibility that I used to have with my old Jekyll site, but it also allows for much easier integration of R code. 

If any of this seems useful, see the underlying [Github repo](https://github.com/dajmcdon/dajmcdon.github.io) for the code. There are script files that control the artwork as well as autogenerating the list of publications (a massive headache in other static site generators).

## Personal

I still play cello occasionally, and I enjoy listening to classical music whenever I get the chance. I've only once successfully connected [research and music](/chopin-2022-slides), but this leaves music to be a nice hobby, a total diversion from academic work.

I should also point to my partner's website: [Tamara Mitchell](https://tamaraleemitchell.github.io). She does great work in Hispanic literature, and we're lucky to be at the same institution. We also have two wonderful cats that we spoil rotten.
