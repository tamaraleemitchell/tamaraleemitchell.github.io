## Applying to UBC Statistics or MDS Programs 

I generally have no special powers when it comes to being admitted to MSc/PhD or MDS programs. At UBC, students are admitted to the department before choosing an advisor later in their program. If you are interested, I encourage you to consult the [department website](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate).

If you want to learn more, your best bet is to email the [Graduate Admissions Officer](mailto:admiss@stat.ubc.ca).

## Requesting letters of recommendation 

I frequently get requests for letters of recommendation, and I'm generally happy to comply. However, unless we regularly interacted, it is unlikely that I can provide useful information to a recruiter or admissions committee member. In these cases, I can provide a "took a class with me letter", but I **highly** recommend asking someone else who can provide more detailed descriptions of your unique strengths. If you are currently enrolled in class with me, I will ask that you attend office hours, ask questions, of in another way give me some information about yourself.

In order for me to write, I will need at least **two** weeks notice before the first deadline. 

-   A list of all positions to which you are applying along with deadlines for each.

-   A recent CV or resume that includes a list of courses taken in your major and a unofficial transcript.

-   A personal statement (likely the one you're sending in one of the applications).

-   Answers to the following questions as possible:
    1.  For what class(es) have I been the instructor and how did you distinguish yourself in my class(es)? Did we have any notable interactions I should highlight.
    2.  What makes me particularly qualified to write a letter for you?
    3.  What are your long-term goals?
    4. A list of 3 adjectives that describe you with a sentence saying why. Be creative.
