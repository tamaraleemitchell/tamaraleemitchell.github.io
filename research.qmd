## Overview

I specialize in 20th- and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction, as well as in broad comparative areas that reach into other disciplines and traditions: Latina/o Studies, critical theory, political philosophy, and border and diaspora studies. My research is animated by questions of political agency, economic precarity, and the violence that obtains throughout waning national modernity, as well as by the ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes burgeoning neoliberal globalization.

My dissertation analyzed the novels of Chilean-Mexican-Catalunyan author Roberto Bolaño and Honduran-Salvadoran-US-Latino author Horacio Castellanos Moya as a means of conceptualizing the rise of what I call "post-national literature," which refers to literary works that comment on and critique, both formally and thematically, the shifting dynamics of the nation state as neoliberal globalization becomes the dominant ordering system of world relations. To do this, I analyzed these authors' engagements with literary and aesthetic traditions, particularly realism and the avant-garde, to demonstrate that a dialectic emerges between their works and the literary past that opens a space to interrogate the place of aesthetic praxis as neoliberal globalization becomes ascendant. Finally, I examined Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s literary rejections of Leftist militant reason and discussed how their novels offer an internal critique of the Left's complicity in the rise of neoliberal globalization. 

My current book project, _Novel Crises: Postnational Fiction in Neoliberal Mexico and Central America_, examines contemporary novels that represent and respond to burgeoning neoliberal globalization. In it, I read late-20th and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction—produced both domestically and in the diaspora—to two ends. First, I attend to the ways in which, with a distinctly neoliberal aesthetic, each work meditates on and denaturalizes the notion of "national" literatures. Second, I situate each novel in relation to the literary tradition that precedes it, and I consider how political and economic upheaval is accompanied by a related literary crisis. To this end, _Novel Crises_ asks: If the novel is the genre par excellence of national modernity, what becomes of this literary form as neoliberal economic relations come to replace the nation state? In different ways, each of the novels that I examine poses this question, narrating not only the economic and biopolitical crises of the neoliberal present, but also recognizing their own status as works in crisis. I read novels by Roberto Bolaño, Laury Leite, Valeria Luiselli, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Claudia Hernández, and Carol Zardetto as post-national narratives, and I attend to the ways in which politics, economics, ethics, and aesthetics become entangled in these works. Along the way, my project engages with diverse theoretical perspectives, such as Critical Race Theory, Migration and Diaspora Studies, continental philosophy, and Sound Studies.

I am working on a second book project, tentatively titled _Sounds of the Capitalocene: Violence and Aurality in Latin American Narrative Fiction_, that considers how 20th- and 21st-century authors turn to aurality in narrative fiction as a means of critiquing and responding to exclusionary politics, economic inequalities, gendered violence, and ecological devastation of the neoliberal present. In it, I read fiction by authors such as Ana Castillo, Yuri Herrera, Emiliano Monge, Guadalupe Nettel, Juan Villoro, and Augustín Yáñez, whose work, I argue, engages with sound, silence, and listening as a means of grappling with the inequalities and cruelty of advanced capitalism.
