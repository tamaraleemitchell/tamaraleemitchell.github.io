I specialize in 20th- and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative
fiction, as well as in broad comparative areas that reach into other disciplines
and traditions: sound studies, critical theory, political philosophy, and border
and diaspora studies. My research is animated by questions of political agency,
economic precarity, and the effects of extractivist practices, as well as by the
ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes neoliberal globalization
and its offshoots, especially the Capitalocene.

My first book, _Novel Distortions: Postnational Form in Mexican and Central
American Narrative_ (under contract with Pittsburgh University Press,
Illuminations Series), considers literary responses to the shifting grounds of
national modernity in Latin America. The novel emerged in lockstep with the
nation state, serving as the cultural counterpart to the state's political form
in the modern era. However, these dynamics are unraveling as the _raison d'être_
of the contemporary state veers from its people to the neoliberal market. _Novel
Distortions_ theorizes this emergent political and literary epoch through the
lens of postnationalism, which describes the altered but still active role of
the patriarchal nation state in society and culture, as well as the way in which
novelistic form inscribes and is a symptom of these changes. Centered on the
Mexican and Central American context, the book examines narrative fiction whose
postnational aesthetics conceptualize and lend intelligible shape to the social
worlds generated by the gradual and uneven turn away from national modernity.
Recalling how these two phallogocentric forms—-the novel and the nation—-developed
alongside one another, I situate each work in relation to the literary tradition
that precedes it, considering how political and economic upheaval is accompanied
by related changes to narrative form. In this regard, _Novel Distortions_ asks: _If
the novel is the genre par excellence of national modernity, what becomes of
this literary form as the hegemony of the nation state is undermined by
postnational logic?_ Reading novels by Roberto Bolaño,
Laury Leite, Valeria Luiselli, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Claudia Hernández, and
Carol Zardetto as postnational narratives, the book shows how Mexican and Central American
narrative fiction illuminates our comprehension of politics and envisions new
forms of community and relationality from the postnational present.

I am working on a second book project, tentatively titled _Sounds of the
Capitalocene: Extraction and Aurality in Mexican Literature_, that considers how
20th- and 21st-century authors mobilize sound and listening in distinct literary
texts as a means of responding to exclusionary politics, economic inequalities,
gendered violence, and ecological devastation of advanced capitalism. In it, I
read authors such as Amaranta Caballero Prado, Dahlia de la Cerda, Jorge Comensal, Inti García Santamaría, Yuri Herrera,
Xavier Icaza, Emiliano Monge, Mariana Oliver, Guadalupe Nettel, and Cristina Rivera
Garza, whose works position listening as a form of care in the extractivist
present and whose texts turn to sound, silence, and hearing to imagine
alternatives to the social and environmental devastation of developmentalist and
capitalist logic.
