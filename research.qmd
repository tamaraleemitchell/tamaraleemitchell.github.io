I specialize in 20th- and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction, as well as in broad comparative areas that reach into other disciplines and traditions: Latina/o Studies, critical theory, political philosophy, border and diaspora studies, and sound studies. My research is animated by questions of political agency, economic precarity, and the effects of extractivist practices, as well as by the ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes burgeoning neoliberal globalization.

My dissertation analyzed the novels of Chilean-Mexican-Catalunyan author Roberto Bolaño and Honduran-Salvadoran author Horacio Castellanos Moya as a means of conceptualizing the rise of what I call "post-national literature," which refers to literary works that comment on and critique, both formally and thematically, the shifting dynamics of the nation state as neoliberal globalization becomes the dominant ordering system of world relations. To do this, I analyzed these authors' engagements with literary and aesthetic traditions, particularly realism and the avant-garde, to demonstrate that a dialectic emerges between their works and the literary past that opens a space to interrogate the place of aesthetic praxis as neoliberal globalization becomes ascendant. Finally, I examined Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s literary rejections of Leftist militant reason and discussed how their novels offer an internal critique of the Left's complicity in the rise of neoliberal globalization. 

My current book project, _Novel Distortions: Postnational Form and Mexican and Central American Narrative_, examines contemporary novels that represent and respond to the effects of neoliberal globalization on national modernity and the form of the novel. In it, I read late-20th and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction—produced both domestically and in the diaspora—to two ends. First, I attend to the ways in which, with a distinctly neoliberal aesthetic, each work meditates on and denaturalizes the notion of "national" literatures. Second, I situate each novel in relation to the literary tradition that precedes it, and I consider how political and economic upheaval is accompanied by a related literary crisis. To this end, _Novel Distortions_ asks: If the novel is the genre par excellence of national modernity, what becomes of this literary form as neoliberal economic relations undermine the form and function of the nation state? In different ways, each of the novels that I examine poses this question, narrating not only the economic and biopolitical crises of the neoliberal present, but also recognizing their own status as works in crisis. I read novels by Roberto Bolaño, Laury Leite, Valeria Luiselli, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Claudia Hernández, and Carol Zardetto as post-national narratives, and I attend to the ways in which politics, economics, ethics, and aesthetics become entangled in these works. Along the way, my project engages with diverse theoretical perspectives, such as Critical Race Theory, Migration and Diaspora Studies, continental philosophy, and Sound Studies.

I am working on a second book project, tentatively titled _Sounds of the Capitalocene: Extraction and Aurality in Mexican Literature_, that considers how 20th- and 21st-century authors mobilize sound and listening in distinct literary texts as a means of responding to exclusionary politics, economic inequalities, gendered violence, and ecological devastation of advanced capitalism. In it, I read authors such as Ave Barrera, Jorge Comensal, Inti García Santamaría, Yuri Herrera, Xavier Icaza, Emiliano Monge, Guadalupe Nettel, and Cristina Rivera Garza, whose works position listening as a form of care in the extractivist present and whose texts turn to sound, silence, and hearing to imagine alternatives to the social and environmental devastation of developmentalist and capitalist logic.
