Tamara L. Mitchell is Assistant Professor of Spanish at the University of
British Columbia, Vancouver, where she teaches 20th- and 21st-century Latin
American literatures and cultures. Her research considers the
entanglement of aesthetics, politics, and economics in 20th- and 21st-century
Mexican and Central American literature. Her emerging work draws on
cultural sound studies to question how sound and listening are wielded in
Mexican literary and cultural expression as a means of responding to
the violence of advanced capitalism, including effects on both human and
more-than-human beings and world(view)s.
